Paper: LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS FROM EEG WITH DEEP RECURRENT-CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS

Aimed at extracting features whilst accounting for inter-subject invariants.

A deep recurrent convectional neural network trained on EEG movie.

ConvNets are used for extracting spatial and spectral invariants (for each frame).

Why are LSTMs used for extracting temporal features?

Most important features are from the frequency domain.
 - Usually studied using a spectrogram of the signal.
 - EEG has an additional spatial domain.

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed on the time series for each trial to estimate the power spectrum of the signal.
 - Oscillatory cortical activity related to memory operations primarily exists in three frequency bands of theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), and beta (13-30Hz)
 - Sum of squared absolute values within each of the three frequency bands was computed and used as separate measurement for each electrode.
 - TODO: What are the frequency bands that we are concerned with.

Forming a feature vector ignores the inherent structure of the data in space, frequency and time.
 - Instead, transform the measurements into a 2D image to preserve the spatial structure; and
 - Use multiple colour channels to represent the spectral dimension; finally
 - Use the sequence of images derived from consecutive time windows to account for temporal evolutions in brain activity.

Width and height of the image represent the spatial distribution of activities over the cortex.

The EEG electrodes are distributed over the scalp in a three-dimensional space. In order to trans- form the spatially
distributed activity maps as 2-D images, we need to first project the location of electrodes from a 3-dimensional space onto a 2-D surface.
 - Should also preserve the relative distance between neighboring electrodes.
 - Use the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection (AEP) also known as Polar Projection.
 - A drawback of this method is that the distances between the points on the map are only preserved with respect to a
 single point (the center point) and therefore the relative distances between all pairs of electrodes will not be exactly preserved.
    - TODO: Is there any way to overcome this? Use a CNN on 3D images?
 - Applying AEP to 3-D electrode locations, we obtain 2-D projected locations of electrodes.
 - apply Clough- Tocher scheme (Alfeld, 1984) for interpolating the scattered power measurements over the scalp and for
  estimating the values in-between the electrodes over a 32 × 32 mesh.
 - This procedure is repeated for each frequency band of interest, resulting in three topographical activity maps corresponding to each frequency band.
    - TODO: What are the main frequency bands of interest?
 - The three spatial maps are then merged together to form an image with three (color) channels. (Input for the CNN).

Novelty resides in transforming raw EEG into sequence of images, or frames (EEG ”movie”), combined with recurrent-convolutional
network architecture applied on top of such transformed EEG data

ARCHITECTURE:

ConvNets were used to deal with variations in space and frequency domains due to their ability to learn good two-dimensional representation of the data.
 - Wherever needed, the extracted representa- tions were fed into another layer to account for temporal variations in the data.

We evaluated various types of layers used for extracting temporal patterns, including convolutional and recurrent layers.
